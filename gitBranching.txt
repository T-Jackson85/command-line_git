The command that creates a branch is called git checkout -b

The difference between fast forward and recursive is the fast forwards only happen when there havent been
any commits on the orginal branch while it is beening worked on

to change to another branch use git checkout

To delete a branch use git branch -D

Conflicts occur when git ca decide which file/folder to merge
